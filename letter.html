Dear My Love,

Hey babyy Happy 1st Anniversary to us well this feels like our 2nd because of our past relationship HAHAHAHAH well anyways. I just want you to know how grateful I am to you for the things that you do for me, for being patient, for being understanding to me and specially for loving me unconditionally. I'm really grateful for all of that baby I know that there's a lot of things that we argue about this whole year but I'm glad that we got through it together babyy and no matter how many problem or fights we might have I always know that at the end of the day we'll still be both together.

And I apologize for being too strict with you especially when it comes to your clothes and your so called "Me Time" well I'm still trying to adjust with it and all babyy so please bare with me for a while. I know that when the time is right I'll be able to let you do all of that.

And of course for not making you realize how beautiful you really are sorry for that because I don't take pics of you enough babe I swear that I'll make it up to you this year and that I'll definitely take more pictures of you. I know I have a lot of shortcomings as your boyfriend this year but coming this year I'll make it all up to you baby.

That's all my love and last but not the least I love you so muchhh and I'll love you more and more until the end of time.

Sincerely your one and only baby,  
Andrei
